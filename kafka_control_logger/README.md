# Kafka Control Logger

This module contains the Kafka control logger that consumes control Kafka-ML messages to send them to the Back-end. That's all. These messages will be used in the Back-end to reuse the data streams and send them to other deployed training tasks.

A brief introduction of its files:
- File `logger.py` main file of this module.

## Installation for local development
